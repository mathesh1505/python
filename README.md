# 1 Introduction to programming language:
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It allows developers to write clear, logical code for both small and large-scale projects.
# 1.1 variables:
A variable in Python is a named location in memory used to store data values that can be changed during program execution.
* name = "Mathesh"   string
* age = 21           integer
* height = 7.2       float
* is_emp = true      boolean
# 1.2 Data types:
Data types specify the kind of data a variable can hold in Python. They determine how the computer interprets and stores values.
* int age = 21
* float height = 6.2
* str name ="Mathesh"
* bool is_student = true
* list fruits = ["apple","orange"]
* tuple age = (20,25,28)
* dict student = {"name":"Mathesh","age":22}
# 2 Command Line Basics:
The command line is a text-based interface used to run Python programs and interact with the Python interpreter directly using commands.
* python --version  shows the installed python version
* python file.py    Runs a python program
* pip list          lists all installed packages

# 4 Pythoon Basics:
# 4.1 Variables:
A variable in Python is a name that stores a value in memory.Think of it as a container or a box where you keep data (like numbers, text, etc.) so you can use it later.

# 4.2 Control flow statements:
Control flow statements decide how your program runs — they control which part of the code executes and when.
# conditional statement:
# if statement:
Used when you want to check only one condition.
If it’s true → executes code
If it’s false → does nothing
<img width="1614" height="186" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-13 190235" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5479203-6ba9-447c-aa21-72661bbcba51" />

# if else statement:
One block runs if the condition is true.The other block runs if the condition is false.
if checks a condition — executes code if it’s True.else runs only if the condition is False.

# elif statement:
It allows you to check multiple conditions one after another.

# 5 looping statement:
# 5.1 for loop:
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

# 5.2 While loop:
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

# 6 Functions and modules:
# 6.1 Functions:
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.A function can return data as a result.A function helps avoiding code repetition.

# 6.2 Modules:
Consider a module to be the same as a code library.A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
# 7 Data structures:
# 7.1 Lists:
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.Lists are created using square brackets.

# 7.2 Dictionaries:
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
# 7.3 Tuple:
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

# 7.4 Set:
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable and the duplicates are automatically removed.

# 8 File Handling:
File handling in Python allows you to create, read, write, and delete files stored on your computer.It uses the built-in function open() to access files.
# 9 oops
# 9.1 classes and objects:
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that describe the behavior of the object.
An object is an instance (or a real example) of a class.When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created.

# 9.2 inheritance and polymorphism:
# Inheritance:
Inheritance allows one class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class).It helps to reuse code and create a hierarchy between classes.

# Polymorphism:
Polymorphism means “many forms”.It allows different classes to have methods with the same name, but with different behaviors.
