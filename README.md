# 1 Introduction to programming language:
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It allows developers to write clear, logical code for both small and large-scale projects.
# 1.1 variables:
A variable in Python is a named location in memory used to store data values that can be changed during program execution.
* name = "Mathesh"   string
* age = 21           integer
* height = 7.2       float
* is_emp = true      boolean
# 1.2 Data types:
Data types specify the kind of data a variable can hold in Python. They determine how the computer interprets and stores values.
* int age = 21
* float height = 6.2
* str name ="Mathesh"
* bool is_student = true
* list fruits = ["apple","orange"]
* tuple age = (20,25,28)
* dict student = {"name":"Mathesh","age":22}
# 2 Command Line Basics:
The command line is a text-based interface used to run Python programs and interact with the Python interpreter directly using commands.
* python --version  shows the installed python version
* python file.py    Runs a python program
* pip list          lists all installed packages

# 4 Pythoon Basics:
# 4.1 Variables:
A variable in Python is a name that stores a value in memory.Think of it as a container or a box where you keep data (like numbers, text, etc.) so you can use it later.

# 4.2 Control flow statements:
Control flow statements decide how your program runs â€” they control which part of the code executes and when.
# conditional statement:
# if statement:

# elif statement:
It allows you to check multiple conditions one after another.
